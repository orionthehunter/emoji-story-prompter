# emoji-story-prompter
This is a simple python program that generates nine emoji at random to be used as a prompt for telling a creative story. This was inspired by Rory's Story Cubes:

I made this by prompting ChatGPT to do what it does, then tweaking the results. 
I hope to improve it iteratively to be the best 3x3 random emoji generator it can be. Since this is licensed GPL 3.0 you can do all the things that license permits too! Enjoy.
